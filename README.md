The GGJ is the world's largest game creation event taking place around the globe boasting tens of thousands of participants (jammers) at hundreds of physical and virtual sites in over one hundred countries around the world.

In the 2023 GGJ Edition, we had from Friday 3rd Frebuary 7:00PM to Sunday 5th Frebuary 8:00PM for create a game on the theme : "Roots".

And optionally we can also add constrainsts (called "Diversifiers") to the developpement of the game. You can find the complete list [here](https://globalgamejam.org/news/ggj-2023-diversifiers).

## Description
Rem and the corrupt world is a puzzle game created with unity during the Global Game Jam 2023 where you play a Treant who is Rem. You need to avoid ennemies with your capacity to be a real bush (she think she is a bush so she is a bush) to finally reach the end of the level.

We think that our game complete the "Proximity effect" Diversifier because we made all the sounds with things we had on us (yes one of our members came with a guitar).
